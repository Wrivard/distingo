Project name: Distingo Resto Pub website

Goal: Build a modern, clean, fancy bistro/pub website for “Distingo Resto Pub”. The site should reflect a cozy, upscale pub/bistro vibe, be responsive (mobile + desktop), and include all main pages (Home, About, Menu, Gallery, Contact / Reservations). Use a simple tech stack (Next.js + React + CSS modules or Tailwind CSS) — no heavy frameworks beyond that.

Requirements:
- Homepage: hero section with large hero image (pub interior or a signature dish), headline + subheadline tagline, call-to-action button (“See Menu” or “Book a Table”).
- About page: short description of the restaurant, its concept, atmosphere, location (Montreal), what makes it special (craft cocktails, gourmet dishes, cozy ambience).
- Menu page: display food & drinks categories (starters, mains, desserts, cocktails/beers/wines). Provide example entries (you can stub placeholder items — I’ll fill real menu later).
- Gallery page: a grid gallery for photos (interior shots, dishes, drinks, ambiance) — responsive and optimized for desktop & mobile.
- Contact / Reservations page: show address, opening hours, contact phone/email, embedded map (if possible), and a simple “Reservation request” form (name, email, phone/notes, number of people, date/time) that for now logs submission in console (or stub — backend not mandatory).  
- Site-wide header & footer: header with navigation (Home, About, Menu, Gallery, Contact), footer with basic restaurant info (address, hours, social media placeholders).  
- Responsive design: works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens; navigation should collapse to mobile menu on small screens.  
- Clean, modern styling: neutral / warm-toned colour palette (e.g. dark slate / warm wood / soft amber accents), elegant but readable typography, enough white space, cozy pub-bistro atmosphere.  
- Code structure & good practices: components should be modular (e.g. separate components for Header, Footer, MenuCard, GalleryGrid, etc.), optimize images (use modern image tags or lazy-load), routes set up correctly (e.g. `/`, `/about`, `/menu`, `/gallery`, `/contact`).  

Optional / Nice-to-have:
- Light CSS animations or hover effects on menu items or gallery images (subtle, not distracting).
- Meta tags for SEO (title, description), responsive `<head>` setup.
- A simple site manifest / basic SEO optimizations (e.g. proper HTML semantics, alt tags for images).  
- Placeholder data in JSON or JS — easy to replace later with real content.  

Deliverables:
1. Full project directory with all files (pages, components, styles).  
2. A README with instructions: how to run locally, how to build & deploy (on Replit or other host), how to replace placeholder content (menu, images, contact info).  
3. Commented code where appropriate to help me understand and customize things.  

Tone / Aesthetic: modern, elegant, cozy, inviting — conveys the vibe of an upscale bistro/pub where people feel comfortable, enjoy good food & drinks, and soak in a warm atmosphere.  

---

Please start by creating the project skeleton (with Next.js), setting up layout components (Header, Footer), and building the Homepage (hero section + navigation). Once homepage works, proceed to scaffold the other pages (About, Menu, Gallery, Contact) with placeholder content and styling. Show me where to replace placeholders (menu items, images, contact info) easily.  

At each step, ensure the site runs (no build errors), is responsive, and renders correctly in browser.
